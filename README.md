This is a web application that allows users to track their workouts. The application uses the OpenStreetMap API to display a map of the user's workout route. The application also allows users to create, edit, and delete workouts.

To run the application, clone the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser.

The application is built using the following technologies:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Leaflet
* OpenLayers

The application architecture is as follows:

* The sidebar contains a list of workouts and a form for creating new workouts.
* The map displays the user's workout route.
* The workouts are stored in local storage.

The application logic is implemented in the App class. The App class initializes the map, loads the workouts from local storage, and handles user interactions.

The following is a step-by-step explanation of the code in the App class:

1. The App class constructor gets the user's current location and loads the map.
2. The App class listens for clicks on the map and opens the form for creating a new workout.
3. The App class listens for clicks on the form and creates a new workout object.
4. The App class adds the new workout object to the workouts array.
5. The App class renders the workout on the map and in the list of workouts.
6. The App class listens for clicks on the workouts in the list and opens a popup with more information about the workout.
7. The App class listens for clicks on the cross icon in the workouts list and deletes the workout from the workouts array.
8. The App class listens for clicks on the reset button and clears the workouts array.
9. The App class saves the workouts array to local storage.
